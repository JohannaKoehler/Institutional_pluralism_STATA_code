***Model 1 - individual household level intent to contract (sign up)

*** Read in the file on household level data

drop if functionality_status==3

*** logistic regression for 'want to sign-up' for the entrepreneurial model for those who have not signed up in the first year of the service. 
*** In order to account for higher variation between households of different waterpoints than within the waterpoint user group, standard errors were clustered at user group level (190 clusters) in Model 1.
